Besic implimination of layers separation by separation of concern.

1) Run script that was attached to my eamil to create and seed DB ( update connection string ) 
2) Call api/TakeAway/GetCompanies to GET all companies 
3) Call api/TakeAway/GetReportByParam and pass companyId,startDate,endDate to GET report for employees card holders. 

P.s I also run this soltuion on Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 
Version 15.9.17 just to confirm backward compatibility.
